        <h2>What Are Amphibians?</h2>
        <p>Amphibians are amazing creatures that live both on land and in water. They go through some unique changes as they grow up, and they have some special features that make them stand out!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="info-container">
        <div class="specific-container">
            <h2>1. Amphibians Have Smooth Skin</h2>
            <p>Instead of scales or fur, amphibians have smooth, moist skin. Their skin helps them breathe and stay hydrated, especially when they're in water.</p>
        </div>
        <div class ="specific-container">
            <h2>2. Amphibians Are Cold-Blooded</h2>
            <p>Like reptiles, amphibians are cold-blooded, meaning they rely on the environment to control their body temperature. They need warm weather to stay active.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="info-container">
        <div class ="specific-container">
            <h2>3. Amphibians Lay Eggs in Water</h2>
            <p>Most amphibians lay eggs in water. Their eggs hatch into larvae, like tadpoles, that live in water before growing into adult amphibians that can live on land.</p>
        </div>
        <div class ="specific-container"> 
            <h2>4. Amphibians Can Breathe Through Their Skin</h2>
            <p>Amphibians can absorb oxygen through their skin, especially when they're in water. Some also have lungs to breathe air, like frogs when they’re on land.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class ="info-container">
        <div class ="specific-container">
            <h2>5. Amphibians Go Through Metamorphosis</h2>
            <p>Amphibians change a lot as they grow. For example, a tadpole starts out swimming in the water with a tail and no legs, but it eventually grows legs and becomes a frog!</p>
        </div>
        <div class ="specific-container">
            <h2>6. Amphibians Live in Wet Environments</h2>
            <p>Amphibians prefer places where it’s damp or wet, like ponds, marshes, and rainforests. This helps keep their skin moist and supports their life cycle.</p>
