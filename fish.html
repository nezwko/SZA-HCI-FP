        <h2>What Are Fish?</h2>
        <p>Fish are fascinating creatures that live in water and come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. They are one of the oldest and most diverse groups of animals on Earth!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="info-container">
        <div class="specific-container">
            <h2>1. Fish Have Scales</h2>
            <p>Fish have smooth, protective scales that cover their bodies. These scales help them swim easily and stay safe from harm in the water.</p>
        </div>
        <div class ="specific-container">
            <h2>2. Fish Breathe Through Gills</h2>
            <p>Unlike mammals, fish use gills to breathe underwater. Gills take oxygen from the water, allowing fish to live in oceans, rivers, and lakes.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="info-container">
        <div class ="specific-container">
            <h2>3. Fish Are Cold-Blooded</h2>
            <p>Fish are cold-blooded, meaning their body temperature matches the temperature of the water around them. When the water is cold, they slow down; when it's warm, they become more active.</p>
        </div>
        <div class ="specific-container"> 
            <h2>4. Fish Lay Eggs</h2>
            <p>Most fish lay eggs in the water. Baby fish, called fry, hatch from these eggs and grow in the water. Some fish, like sharks, give birth to live babies.</p>

        <div class ="specific-container">
            <h2>5. Fish Have Fins</h2>
            <p>Fish have fins that help them swim smoothly through the water. They use their fins to steer, stop, and balance. Some fish also have tails that help them swim fast!</p>
        </div>
        <div class ="specific-container">
            <h2>6. Fish Live in Water</h2>
            <p>Fish are aquatic animals, meaning they live in water. They can be found in oceans, rivers, lakes, and even ponds. Some fish live deep in the ocean, while others live closer to the surface.</p>
