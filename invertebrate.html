        <h2>What Are Invertebrates?</h2>
        <p>Invertebrates are animals that don’t have a backbone (spine). They make up about 97% of all animal species on Earth, and they can be found everywhere—from the ocean to your backyard!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="info-container">
        <div class="specific-container">
            <h2>1. Invertebrates Don’t Have a Backbone</h2>
            <p>Unlike mammals, birds, and reptiles, invertebrates don’t have a spine. Instead, their bodies are supported in different ways, like exoskeletons (hard outer shells) or soft bodies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class ="specific-container">
            <h2>2. Invertebrates Have Different Body Structures</h2>
            <p>Invertebrates come in many shapes and sizes. Some, like insects, have hard outer coverings called exoskeletons. Others, like jellyfish, have soft bodies that are flexible and squishy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class ="specific-container">
            <h2>3. Invertebrates Live in Many Habitats</h2>
            <p>Invertebrates can be found in almost every environment—whether it’s underwater, on land, or even in the air. They live in forests, oceans, deserts, and gardens!</p>
        </div>
        <div class ="specific-container"> 
            <h2>4. Invertebrates Move in Different Ways</h2>
            <p>Invertebrates move in a variety of ways. Some, like snails, crawl slowly along the ground, while others, like jellyfish, drift through the water. Insects use their legs to walk, and some, like butterflies, can even fly!</p>

            <h2>5. Invertebrates Have Unique Ways of Reproducing</h2>
            <p>Invertebrates can reproduce in different ways. Many lay eggs, while others, like starfish, can grow new body parts. Some invertebrates even have special ways of changing or growing, such as metamorphosis.</p>

            <h2>6. Invertebrates Are Important to Ecosystems</h2>
            <p>Invertebrates play a vital role in nature! They help pollinate plants, decompose dead animals and plants, and provide food for many larger animals.</p>
